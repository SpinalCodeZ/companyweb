  This is a template for a bussiness site. Specificly a blog format or a website to hold resources. Really you can just make it whatever you want. I wrote an article on the Cross, and it's significance. Defently give it a read! I plan to work on this site privately so when it gets done I'll give an update! Enjoy the repo!
