                Have you ever done research and I mean real research about the cross?
                The crucifixion wasn’t just for Jesus. In fact, it was a very popular
                punishment back in the days of Jesus. The Romans were very fond of
                using it but, Jesus had the worst crucifixion of them all. I’ll break
                it down and tell you what the science is, why Jesus' was the worst,
                why it’s the most amazing act of love, and how we're meant to carry
                our cross daily.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-white leading-6">
                For you guys who don’t know how crucifixion works, I will go over a
                quick explanation. The first thing to remember is you're hanging on a
                cross. Allowing your hands to be outstretched and your feet to be
                close together, or atop one another. The way the feet were done was by
                placing them on a small block where you could stand but were
                ultimately using the block to push yourself up and down. We will get
                to that part later, but let's move on to the hands. When we think of
                crucifixion it is oftentimes thought to involve nails piercing each
                hand. This is factually inaccurate, see Jesus never broke a bone in
                his body so how were His hands pierced? Back in the time of Jesus
                hands actually included the wrist area, since science wasn’t as
                developed, as today. Meaning then the nails were inserted in the wrist
                under the palm in between the two bones, in your forearm. Being one of
                the places your nerves travel through up to your hand. A nail
                therefore would have the ability to push those nerves when you push
                your body up. Picture this, Jesus is nailed on a cross and to breathe
                He has to push himself up, by doing this the nail presses on those
                nerves. Causing the most excruciating pain and therefore making the
                most painful death imaginable. Now why would you need to push yourself
                up to breathe. The way you hang on the cross actually pushes fluid
                into your lungs, making you suffocate. This is when you would be
                hanging down, but not being able to breathe forces you to push
                yourself up thus pressing the nerves in your wrist, causing the worst
                imaginable pain. Do you understand why this is the worst possible way
                to die? It can go on for hours. To make it worse the Romans who stood
                at the crucifixions would eventually break the legs of the crucified,
                forcing suffocation after hours of excruciating pain. That’s the
                baseline explanation of crucifixion and how it actually works. Jesus’
                sacrifice was so powerful and held the worst pain in all crucifixions.
                The Lord’s death was the most excruciating and painful death to have
                ever been or will ever be.

            <p class="text-white leading-6">
                You know crucifixion is the worst way to die, but what made Jesus’ the
                worst one? He was beaten, and not just a whip. A whip that was
                designed to rip flesh from the body, the cat of nine tails. If you
                only knew the pain that alone caused, but it doesn’t stop there. He
                was beaten so bad you couldn’t recognize Him. You couldn’t tell if He
                was a male or a female. He was shredded. The Romans then took a purple
                cloak or cloth and placed it on His back to mock Him. Purple is the
                color of royalty, and Christ claiming to be God. The Romans mocked him
                by placing the cloth on him and then letting the blood dry to it. Once
                dried the cloth was ripped from his body opening all the wounds that
                had adhered to the cloth. Imagine the pain of the beaten atop the
                ripping and reopening of wounds over and over. Then imagine having a
                crown of thorns pushed into your head. The crown of thorns wasn’t made
                from something small like a rose's thorn, rather large thorns grouped
                together and bound to make a crown. Then shoved on his head piercing
                his flesh and planting itself into His head. This was to mock Jesus
                further by giving Him a “king's crown.” Then on the cross, Jesus faced
                all the sins to ever exist all at once. It is unimaginable to even
                comprehend. Imagine all your sins and all the negative depression you
                have or have ever had, imagine the lies, the crime, the uncountable
                sin. Now imagine it from everyone all at once. If that’s not enough
                look into the world today and tell me, is it a loving kind world? No,
                it's not. Jesus hung on a cross with it all at once. And we dare to
                sin. We are nothing, less than dirt to the King of Kings, yet He loves
                us. Jesus paid the price for us to have the ability to be with Him in
                Paradise, and we turn from Him. Think of that and know Jesus laid His
                life down for you, so love Him like a child loves their mother. Cling
                to Him and beg for forgiveness and grace. I just can’t express this
                with words.

            <p class="text-white leading-6">
                I am assuming by now you understand why this is the greatest act of
                love.

                We are told to pick up our cross daily and for us to truly understand
                this we must understand the meaning. It isn’t talking of a literal
                cross but rather the metaphorical cross, we need to carry. Jesus paid
                the price for us, so pick yourself up and deny those temptations,
                don’t fall into lust, visit and care for the lost, love your enemy,
                love your neighbor. You’re a fool if you think Christianity is easy.
                You're a fool to call yourself a Christian yet don’t grab your cross
                and carry it daily. I understand we fail, but don’t you ever give up.
                Don’t you fall into the worldly way. Pray! Pray! Pray! You must pray
                and ask The Heavenly Father to guide you. I used to think to myself,
                “I don’t deserve to be forgiven, so don’t forgive me.” You know what’s
                funny, that’s the dumbest thought to think. Christ died for us already
                and His grace is already there for us. How can I be unforgiven when
                the Father already forgave me. Don’t mistake this for not needing to
                repent, rather know, that through repentance Christ forgives. I will
                go into repentance in a later article, since it isn’t just a simple,”
                I’m sorry.”
