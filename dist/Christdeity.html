            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">The person of Jesus Christ is considered to be the true living God, a
                prophet, a man, myth, legend.
                What’s He say about Himself? Was He even real? What’s up with this idea of God and salvation? If you
                ever wondered these things don’t worry, let’s dive into these questions together.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">Let’s discuss the person of Jesus Christ, From a Christian perspective He is
                considered God, God
                incarnate, the Living Word, the list goes on. Why would Christians believe such a claim? We can start by
                looking into the Old Testament, finding prophecies. Prophecies of a Messiah, a Savior who would come to
                save us. It goes into detail obviously, but for now just take the numbers into perspective. During Jesus
                earthly ministry He fulfilled at least three-hundred prophecies (gotquestions.org). Imagine that for a
                second. Don’t think, “300 seems small why not like a million?” One prophecy for example said Jesus would
                end up in Egypt. Being fulfilled in Matthew 2:14–15</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic">“So he [Joseph] got up, took the child and his mother during the
                night and
                left for Egypt, where he
                stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: ‘Out
                of Egypt I called my son’” (jesufilm.org).</p>
            <p>The story goes as follows, Hosea 11:1</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic"> “When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called
                my son”.
            </p>
            <p>the Lord, Jesus would end up in Egypt. Joseph brought Jesus to
                Egypt at a young age and there
                they waited for the Death of King Herod. This fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy from Hosea 11:1. Now
                imagine two-hundred-ninety-nine more fulfilled prophecies.</p>
            <p class="text-black indent-14"> Some claim Jesus was a prophet, but had no deity and was not God. Islam
                claims The Lord Jesus was a
                prophet loved by God, but was not God. This is a misconception from the Quran (Islam’s holy book). In
                order to maintain integrity with facts, we must look to the Quran to see what the book says.</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic"> Surah 2:136</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic"> We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to
                Abraham,
                Isma’il, Isaac, Jacob, and the
                Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no
                difference between one and another of them . . .</p>
            <p>This is one reference for a more complete list check out namb.net
                (namb.net). The point remains, from an
                Islamic worldview Jesus Christ was a prophet.</p>
            <p class="text-black indent-14">How do we know to trust the Quran vs The Bible? Read them. Simple enough,
                just read both and compare.
                Daunting a task, but at least do your research before you decide what you believe. Christians would
                argue, the Quran promotes the belief in the Injeel (The Gospel). John 10:30 clearly quotes Jesus saying,
                “I and the Father are one.” With many other claims to be God found in the Injeel (The Gospel), the
                argument is securing the unreliable nature of the Quran making it corrupt. It counteracts itself.
                Countering from an Islamic perspective, asserts the idea of corruption in the Biblical text due to
                translation error over the years. Ending the discussion with a simple fact, the Quran came after the
                Bible. The Injeel (The Gospels) were written by eyewitnesses to Jesus Christ, while the Quran was
                written by no eye witnesses. Other religions bring to light The Lord Jesus Christ, there must be
                something to look at and think about.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">Man, Myth, Legend. Common phrasing when describing a fictional character.
                Maybe you’ve heard a similar
                phrase when reading comics or watching a film about superheros (Jesus is my superhero). Lets take a
                minute and discuss the idea of Jesus Christ as a man, as a myth, and as a legend.</p>
            <p class="text-black indent-14">Jesus Christ as a man is straightforward, in fact, the Bible is a well
                respected historical book by
                different religious demographics. Historians have written about His life, and confirm Jesus’ existence.
                Flavius Josephus wrote in Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 3, Section 3,</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic">“Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful
                to call
                him a man; for he was a doer
                of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both
                many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of
                the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
                forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold
                these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from
                him, are not extinct at this day”(biblestudytools.com).</p>
            <p>is historical confirmation that Jesus Christ was in fact alive and a man among us. This also
                confirms the resurrection of Christ, from a historical point of view.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">To consider Jesus Christ’s existence to be myth or legend stems from
                skeptics who refuse the truth. Not
                considering the faith aspect or deity claims found in The Holy Bible, it is still an undeniable fact
                that Jesus Christ did live. One claim considers The New Testament to be compared with fairy tale. This
                of course falls in line with a radical skeptic worldview. Dismissed with the idea that anything you
                cannot see must not be real.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">What’s Jesus say about Himself? We look to Scripture for the answer, and if
                your in a relationship with
                Him, just ask Him. We point to The Gospels, to read direct quotes of what Jesus says. In John 11:25
                (ESV)</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic">“Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever
                believes
                in me, though he die, yet
                shall he live,”</p>
            <p>Jesus claims to be the resurrection and the life, using an I AM statement. This is powerful because in
                the Torah God says, I AM WHO I AM.</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic">Exodus 3:14</p>
            <p class="text-black text-center italic">“God said to Moses, “I am who I am.” And he said, “Say this to the
                people
                of Israel: ‘I am has sent me
                to you.’”</p>
            <p>The I AM statement is a clear way of saying Jesus is God. To the Jews the I AM is considered to be God.
                Thus making Jesus’ statement in John 11:25 proof He is God, from His own account.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">The question of whether Jesus was even real is answered through historians,
                such as Flavius Josephus
                mentioned above. Another source for historical information is the Roman historian Tacitus. Reading “The
                Annals of Imperial Rome” book 15 (tektonics.org). We have proof then from different historians for the
                existence of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-black indent-14">What’s the idea of God and Salvation? In ancient Hebrew, you can read the
                name Yeshua, which means
                Yahweh Saves/ Yahweh’s Salvation. This is important due to the fact Jesus is called Yeshua. Indicating
                that Jesus offers salvation, which comes from a relationship with Him. We are saved by grace, and Jesus
                saves us with His death and resurrection. If you want that relationship with Jesus, call to Him and open
                your heart. Ask Him to come into your life, and save you.</p>
